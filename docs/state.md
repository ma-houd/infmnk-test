# ðŸ§  State

You might not have used state management for the core objectives as the tiny scope of the application does not requires
it. Nevertheless, you can add one to the app and rewrite the data flows to leverage it as much as possible.

> ðŸ’¡ Prefer [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/) for your state management provider.
> ```
> npm install @ngxs/store --save
> ```
