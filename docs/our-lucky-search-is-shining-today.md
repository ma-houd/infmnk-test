# Our lucky search is shining today!

As more and more species get discovered, the list page reveals itself to be not super user friendly for find a species
quickly. To address that, we'll add a search bar to display a filtered list.

## 1. Search bar

In the list page, add a text input that will serve as search bar. Hook it to the controller so that a method is called
as soon as the searched value is modified.

## 2. Enhance the service

In our service, update the method that retrieves the list of species so that it can receive a search string as argument
and forward it to the API in the form of a search parameter.

## 3. Plug everything

Now in the list page controller, the method which is called upon search value modification should trigger a new API call
to retrieve the filtered list. When the filtered list is received, the list page should update accordingly.

> 💡 Yes, this approach is sub-optimal as we could simply filter on the entire that was received upon page load. But
> building with the service allows us to easily switch to a paginated list in the future.

> 🟢 Validate this feature with :
> ```shell
> npm run test -- search-bar
> ```
