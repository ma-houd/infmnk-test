# ðŸ§  Squeeze performances

Squeeze as much performance as you can from the app. We expect to see:

- module lazy loading
- species list leveraging the pagination provided by the API (see
  the [`GET /species`](https://www.pokedexercice.ch/documentation/get/species) documentation for more information).
- species list search bar bound with the `keyup` event to the search method but with debounced effect
