# Angular Application Exercise

This repository contains the boilerplate for an application specifically designed to test your abilities as a **Angular
developer**. This README contains instructions to get you started and details what you are expected to do.

You should keep an eye out for the following icons:

- üéØ designates a **primary** objective that you _MUST_ complete.
- üß† designates a **bonus** objective that you _CAN_ complete.
- üí° designates a **hint** that may provide additional help.
- üü¢ designates a **test** command that can be run to validate your implementation. Note that for the test to run, the
  app must be accessible on `http://localhost:4200`. Make sure you have a terminal running `npm start` in parallel of
  your tests.

## The project

Your goal is to make a Pokedex application to browse Pokemons species, identify new ones and display species details. A
dedicated API is available and the boilerplate of the application has already been done. You can now take over and
fill-in the core features.

## Prerequisites

The application is built with **[Angular 16](https://angular.io/)**. You'll need [node 18](https://nodejs.org/en) to
build and run the application locally.

## Getting started

The following steps will ensure that everything is ready for you to start the exercise. Open up your favorite terminal
and follow along.

1. Clone this repository

2. Change into the project's directory
    ```
    cd /path/to/repository
    ```

3. Install dependencies
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

4. Start serving the application
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see a login form for the
   Pokedex.

6. Head over to [www.pokedexercice.ch](https://www.pokedexercice.ch) to register and get your trainer token.

7. Back to the login form, enter your token. You should now see a page with "Hello trainer!"

## üéØ Objectives

Here are the features we'd like you to develop. We recommend sticking to the order below for a smoother experience.

Focus your efforts on the functional aspects. Styling should be decent on all kind of screen (mobile, tablet, desktop)
but we don't expect the app to be too fancy.

The whole exercise should take you 2 to 3 hours. Let us know if you spent more than that (particularly on the bonus
objectives) so we can evaluate your work properly.

> üí° Do not hesitate to run the provided test commands while implementing these objectives, as it will help you to make
> sure that everything is working as intended. If a test is failing, but you are convinced that your implementation is
> correct, don't worry about it; the code will still be reviewed and tested manually.
